-------
My apologies to the hardcore open source community of not applying the stricter GPL license. However, ``SiMu`` is mainly aiming to be used in industrial settings, and it is important for most organizations for their derived software not being required to be open source as well, even if shared with externals (hence legally distributed).

The entire concept of ``SiMu`` is to enable encapsulation of intellectual property for in-house usage and when sharing with business partners. Applying the GPL license would limit the scope of this software to hobby-enthusiasts and with luck some academic usage, but not help solving everyday problems in the industry.

On the other hand, more liberal licenses would encourage users to take this code apart and create private forks. This is something I probably cannot prevent entirely, but I do not wish. I hope that parallel developments can to large degree be included into ``SiMu``.
